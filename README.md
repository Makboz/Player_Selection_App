# Player_Selection_App
My first Flask Web application to facilitate the coach of my school’s Cricket Team and myself, the captain, in the trials and selection of students in the team.

Check out the website: https://playerselection.pythonanywhere.com/

# Results
- Increased flexibility and accessibility for the Selection Committee to view and add player profiles.
- Streamlined the process of registering trialists which in turn helped devote more time to the trials.

# Application
#### Flask, Python, SQLite, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
- The user (myself or the coach) would input the player’s biodata and the coach's input on their performance based on which a profile of the player would be created in the SQLite database and be displayed at the bottom of the app along with all the other profiles for the selection committee to review.
